## 🌐 Live Demo

🔗 **Website**: [https://kishortailor.netlify.app/](https://kishortailor.netlify.app/)

## 📘 Project Overview

This is a modern and responsive website I created for my father's tailoring business – **Kishor Tailor**. The website introduces services, showcases tailoring work, and allows customers to contact or visit the shop.

Built with **React.js**, and includes email functionality using **EmailJS**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring a full React project for a local business
- Sending form emails using **EmailJS** without backend
- Integrating contact forms and handling inputs
- Deploying React apps on **Netlify**

## ✨ Website Features

- 💼 Tailoring service introduction
- 📞 Contact form using **EmailJS**
- 📍 Business location and about section
- 🧾 Clean and responsive design

## 📧 EmailJS Integration

Used [**EmailJS**](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send emails directly from the contact form without any backend.

### 🛠️ How It Works:

1. Create an EmailJS account and setup a service, template, and user ID.
2. Installed EmailJS in project:

```bash
npm install @emailjs/browser
