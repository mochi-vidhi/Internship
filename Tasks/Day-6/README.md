# 🚀 Day 6: Multi-Step Form Wizard (React)

This is my Day 6 project for the **15 Days Internship **. I created a **Multi-Step Form Wizard** using **React**, allowing users to fill out a form in steps and review their input before submitting. This improves the user experience by breaking complex forms into manageable parts.
